This task is the implementation of an image processing program that does some basic algorithms like RGB to Gray conversion, moving average
filter and resizing of an image (which will include both upsampling and downsampling the image). The first part of the task is to impelemt
it using single thread, the next part is with multithreaded and final one is multiprocess implementation. 
What you will need to finish this task is:
-Find a library that reads an image from disk and puts it into list.
-Get to know the algorithms that you will implement, you can find information in the internet.
-Implemet the serial code, which is a single process.
-Learn about multithreading library in python, and create the code.
-Learn about multiprocessing library in python and create the code.
Time for this task is 2 days, due date Sunday night.
